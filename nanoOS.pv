# Example PV Linux guest configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# This is a fairly minimal example of what is required for a
# Paravirtualised Linux guest. For a more complete guide see xl.cfg(5)

# Guest name
name = "nanoOS"

# 128-bit UUID for the domain as a hexadecimal number.
# Use "uuidgen" to generate one if required.
# The default behavior is to generate a new UUID each time the guest is started.
#uuid = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Kernel image to boot
kernel = "kobjs-x86_64/nanoOS.elf"

# Ramdisk (optional)
#ramdisk = "/boot/initrd.gz"

# Kernel command line options
#extra = "root=/dev/xvda1"

# Initial memory allocation (MB)
memory = 128

# Maximum memory (MB)
# If this is greater than `memory' then the slack will start ballooned
# (this assumes guest kernel support for ballooning)
#maxmem = 512

# Number of VCPUS
vcpus = 1

device_model_version="qemu-xen-traditional"
device_model_overrid="/bin/true"

# Network devices
# A list of 'vifspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-network-configuration.markdown
vif = [ '' ]

# Disk Devices
# A list of `diskspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt
